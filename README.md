# OOP2-ExtensionsOverloadsMiniProject
The homework from the Lesson 11, Mini Project, of Module 6, Object-Oriented Programming, Part 2, of the Complete Foundation in C# Course Series from Tim Corey. We are to recreate the project we did for this lesson but without looking back over what Tim did. Tweak it slightly as well.
